# Humanitec AI Agent

> Hey beta-tester, nice to have you!

ðŸŒŒÂ [Canyon](https://getcanyon.ai/) is a very early version of a developer self-service AI. Just like you, weâ€™re on a journey to learn whether this could become an important part of the toolchain. Weâ€™re building this product 100% based on user feedback and weâ€™re in love with the problem, not the solution. So please: do not hold back with any critical feedback!

This page will show you how you can integrate Canyon with your Humanitec Organization, and will allow both your Developers and your Platform Engineers boost their productivity in their day-to-day tasks.

## Features supported

![](ai-agent/png)

The Canyon MCP server will be responsible to orchestrate the requests between both:
- Either the Humanitec Documentation (via Kapa.ai);
- Or the Humanitec Orchestrator APIs (via `humctl`).

_Note: The setup could have also pre-configured paths, you can find the code for those paths in [this repo.](https://github.com/humanitec/canyon-demo-samples/tree/main/pipeline-actions-scripts). If interested, please contact us, we will help you set this up._

## Prerequesites

- Access to your own Humanitec Organization.
- [`humctl` CLI](https://developer.humanitec.com/platform-orchestrator/docs/platform-orchestrator/cli/) installed locally - interacts with your own Humanitec Organization.
- [`canyon` CLI](https://github.com/humanitec/canyon-cli) installed locally - forwards context, calls Orchestrator, essentially an MCP server.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed locally with the [Cline extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) - plugin manager for MCP servers, client to execute your prompts.
  - _Note: other client can be used, but that's our recommendation during this beta-testing phase._

## Setup in Cline extension

Our recommendation during this beta-testing phase is to use the [Cline VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev).

You can add a new server, with the config generated by the command:
```bash
canyon install
```

From there are ready to use the Canyon AI.

You can set the model you want to use, for example `gemini-2.5-flash` with which you will need to bring your own `Gemini API Key`.
